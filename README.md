This is my README.md file.

To get started with JSJournal, install from your terminal using the command:

- npx jsjournal serve

This application will allow you to write Javascript and React code, and excecute it in the browser.  


To display your ouput or a React Component in the output window, call the command show() to do so. If you want to log to the browser's console, you can console log normally.

All variables are cached, so you can reference previously declared variables at any time.
